# Smart-Watch-TRC
A Robotiics Club Project

We developed a custom digital smartwatch with a KiCad-designed PCB, powered by an Atmega microcontroller, and featuring an OLED display. The PCB integrates essential components, while the Atmega chip manages key operations such as timekeeping, alarms, and stopwatch functionality. The OLED display offers a clear, user-friendly interface, with side buttons for easy navigation. This project showcases expertise in PCB design, embedded systems, and UI development, resulting in a compact, fully functional smartwatch.
